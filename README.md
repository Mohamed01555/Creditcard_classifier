# Creditcard_classifier

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

So this is a Creditcard fraud detection classifier

This classifier can identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

`You can use it by sending a python list [] which contains 30 nombers` that represent ['Time of process', 'V1', 'V2', 'V3', 'V4', 'V5', 'V6', 'V7', 'V8', 'V9', 'V10','V11', 'V12', 'V13', 'V14', 'V15', 'V16', 'V17', 'V18', 'V19', 'V20','V21', 'V22', 'V23', 'V24', 'V25', 'V26', 'V27', 'V28', 'Amount','Class']
 
Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA

Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data
